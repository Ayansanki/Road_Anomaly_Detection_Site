        <h1>Welcome to Road Anomaly Detection</h1>
        <p>Road Anomaly Detection is an intelligent computer vision-based platform designed to automatically detect road
            damage from user-provided images and videos. Using advanced deep learning techniques and a fine-tuned YOLOv8
            model, our system can quickly identify potholes, cracks, and other road anomalies with high accuracy.
            <br>
            Whether you're a road maintenance authority, a smart city developer, or simply a citizen wanting to
            contribute to safer roads, our platform makes reporting and analyzing road conditions seamless and
            efficient. Just upload your data, and let our AI take care of the rest!
        </p>

        <div>
            <h2>Get Started</h2>
            <p>To begin using the Road Anomaly Detection platform, you can navigate to the following sections:</p>

            <h2>About the Model</h2>
            <p>The core of our road anomaly detection system is built upon the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8)
                architecture, a state-of-the-art deep learning model known for its speed and accuracy in object
                detection tasks. We have fine-tuned this model specifically for road anomaly detection using a
                comprehensive dataset of road images and videos.</p>
            <p>Key features of our model include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Accuracy:</strong> Our fine-tuned YOLOv8 model achieves high precision in detecting
                    various types of road anomalies, including potholes, cracks, and surface deformations.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-time Processing:</strong> The model is optimized for real-time analysis, allowing for
                    quick detection and reporting of road conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Robustness:</strong> Trained on diverse datasets, our model performs well under varying
                    lighting and weather conditions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We continuously update and improve our model to ensure it remains effective in identifying road
                anomalies, contributing to safer and better-maintained roadways.</p>
